3. The HTML code there, described the formal structure of the page. We can clearly see, the "head" in which we can find the title (the upper bar title) and the raleted measurements of this 
section. Then its the body, here the code describe how the page it's gone to loke like, measuring the space and naming each button and text thats going to be there. The code goes from the 
macro, to the micro, i mean, it goes from whats outside (tables, borders, color, etc), to whats inside the page (texts, links, etc).

4. As I open the hn.js file I see only functions, so I guess thats its function is to store functions in a way that we can use them from other places of the code in a simpler way, it 
maight be the "Controller" in an MVC dessign pattern. Then we got the news.css, which I think makes the "Model" part of the design, working with the fonts of the texts, location and 
structure in general and at last there are the other files which are primarly images, so they must be the "View", for the page to look pretier for the user.

5. There are 6 request, i think all 6 of them are GET request because there isn't a button or any other optiom for the user to send information to the server.
